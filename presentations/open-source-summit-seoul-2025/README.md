## Abstract

This presentation, delivered at the Open Source Summit in Korea on November 5, 2025, by Chris Xie of Futurewei and Jesse McCrosky of Egen AI, outlines the critical need for an open-source approach in artificial intelligence to foster a transparent, responsible, and collaborative ecosystem. The speakers argue that as AI becomes a societal operating system, challenges such as limited transparency, proprietary lock-in, and a growing trust deficit must be addressed.

Drawing parallels with the development of Linux, the presentation proposes a vision for "the Linux of AI," an ecosystem built on principles of radical openness, global collaboration, and auditability. Central to this vision is the introduction of the TRUE (Transparent, Reproducible, Understandable, Executable) framework, a comprehensive scoring system designed to assess the openness and reproducibility of AI models. The TRUE framework advocates for sharing not just model weights but also the code, training data, and methodologies.

The presentation serves as a call to action for researchers, developers, and organizations to contribute to building this open framework. It emphasizes that embracing open standards, transparent governance, and collaborative development is essential to ensure that AI evolves from a "closed race for power into a shared journey for progress". The ultimate goal is to create a trustworthy and accessible AI ecosystem that benefits all of humanity.
